# Full Stack App with React and a REST API

In this Project I've used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (the one that I created in previous project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

To complete this project, I've used my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

I've used:

* JavaScript and JSX to build out the components.
* React Router to set up your routes.
* The Fetch API  to fetch data from your REST API.
* Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.
